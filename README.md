# Find Dominant Colors from an Image!

A Flask web application that identifies the dominant colors in an image using machine learning algorithms. Users can upload an image or provide an image URL, and the application processes the image to extract the dominant colors and highlights their presence on the image.

Features

Image Upload: Upload an image from your local machine.

Image URL Input: Provide a URL to fetch an image directly from the web.

Dominant Color Detection: Use machine learning algorithms to find the dominant colors in the image.

Color Mapping: Marks the dominant colors on the image where they are present.

Simple and Intuitive UI: A user-friendly interface to interact with the application.

Technologies Used

Backend: Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: Algorithms for color clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)

Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL (Pillow)
